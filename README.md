# The Linear Regression Project

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of linear regression using Python. It includes functions to estimate the coefficients of a linear regression model and plot the resulting regression line with the given data points. This is a starting point, and additional features will be added over time.

---
### Introduction

This project implements a basic linear regression model to help understand how linear regression works. The project currently includes the following key functions:

- **`estimate_regression_coeficients(x, y)`**: Estimates the slope and intercept of the regression line.
- **`plot_linear_regression(x, y, y_intercept, gradient)`**: Plots the data points along with the regression line.

---
### Features

- **Simple Linear Regression**: Estimate the slope and intercept using the least squares method.
- **Data Visualization**: Plot the data points and regression line using `matplotlib`.

### Installation

To run this project locally, you will need to have Python installed along with the required packages. You can install the necessary dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---
### Usage

You can use the functions provided in this project by importing them into your script. Check the notebooks folder for examples.

---
### Future Work

This project is in its early stages, and I plan to add more features, including:

- **Multiple Linear Regression**
- **Support for different types of data**
- **Evaluation metrics (e.g., R-squared, Mean Squared Error)**
- **Interactive visualizations**
